# Set
A small piece of code which simulate Set matches with the purpose of computing certain probabilities. In particular, it computes: 
- the probability of having no set on the table
- the probability of having 15 cards on the table and having no set
- the probability that when there is only a single card with a certain value (for instance, there is only one red card on the table) that it is part of a set. This means that when there is, for instance, when there is only one single red card on the table, whether you should try to form a set with it or not.

The code could be made a lot more efficient and it might be possible to better organise it, though it does the job.
